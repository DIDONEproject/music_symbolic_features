      <description>Median offset in duration of notes from the idealized durations of each of their nearest quantized rhythmic values, expressed as a fraction of the duration of an idealized quantized quarter note. Offsets are treated as absolute values, so offsets that are longer or shorter than each idealized duration are both treated as identical positive numbers in this calculation. This feature provides an indication of how consistently quantized note durations are or, expressed slightly differently, how well they conform to idealized note durations. Higher values indicate greater average deviation from idealized note durations. Both pitched and unpitched notes are included, and this is calculated without regard to the dynamics, voice or instrument of any given note.</description>

      <name>Parallel Motion</name>
      <description>Fraction of movements between voices that consist of parallel motion (the fraction is calculated relative to the total amount of qualifying transitions, including all parallel, similar, contrary and oblique transitions). If more than two voices are involved in a given pitch transition, then each possible pair of voices comprising the transition is included in the calculation. Note that only transitions from one set of pitches to another set of pitches comprising the same number of pitches as the first are included in this calculation, although a brief lookahead is performed in order to accommodate small rhythmic desynchronizations (e.g. if a MIDI file is a transcription of a human performance). Only unique pitches are included in this calculation (unisons are treated as a single pitch). All pitches present are considered, regardless of their MIDI channel or track; this has the advantage of accommodating polyphonic instruments such as piano or guitar, but the consequence is that this feature does not incorporate an awareness of voice crossing.</description>
